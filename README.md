# local_supervisor
## About
This is a tool for starting and stopping processes on multiple computers from a single GUI. This repository is for the server application written in Visual C++ and includes project files for Visual Studio Express. The GUI is in a different project called [supervisor](http://github.com/brydling/supervisor).
## Usage
The example configuration file included (processes.cfg) shall be put in the same directory as the local_supervisor .exe-file and is configured to work with the example configuration files for supervisor. Start the two programs on the same computer and test. I think the configuration files are pretty self-explanatory.
